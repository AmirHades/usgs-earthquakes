    format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ"
    examples:
      - 1979-12-31T23:42:21.200Z

  - name: latitude
    type: float
    length: [10,7]

  - name: longitude
    type: float
    length: [10,7]

  - name: depth
    type: float
    description: Depth of the event in kilometers.

  - name: mag
    type: float
    description: |
      The magnitude is a number that characterizes the relative size of an earthquake. Magnitude is based on measurement of the maximum motion recorded by a seismograph.

  - name: magType
    type: String
    description: The method or algorithm used to calculate the preferred magnitude for the event. The most commonly used are local magnitude (Ml/ml), commonly referred to as "Richter magnitude", surface-wave magnitude (Ms), body-wave magnitude (Mb/mb), and moment magnitude (Mw)
    examples:
      - ml
      - Ml
      - mb
      - md
      - Unknown
    nulls: true

  - name: nst
    type: integer
    length: 5
    description: "The total number of seismic stations used to determine earthquake location."
    examples:
      - 0
      - 20
      - 885

  - name: gap
    type: float
    length: [4, 1]
    description: |
      The largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees). In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake.

  - name: dmin
    type: float
    length: [4, 1]
    description: |
      Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station (in degrees). 1 degree is approximately 111.2 kilometers. In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated depth of the earthquake.

  - name: rms
    type: float
    length: [6, 2]
    description: |
      The root-mean-square (RMS) travel time residual, in sec, using all weights. This parameter provides a measure of the fit of the observed arrival times to the predicted arrival times for this location. Smaller numbers reflect a better fit of the data. The value is dependent on the accuracy of the velocity model used to compute the earthquake location, the quality weights assigned to the arrival time data, and the procedure used to locate the earthquake.

  - name: net
    type: string
    length: 5
    description: |
      The ID of a data contributor. Identifies the network considered to be the preferred source of information for this event.
    examples:
      - us
      - ci
      - uw
      - nm


  - name: id
    type: string
    length: 10
    description: |
      A (generally) two-character network identifier with a (generally) eight-character network-assigned code. A unique identifier for the event. This is the current preferred id for the event, and may change over time. See the "ids" GeoJSON format property.
    examples:
      - usp000jnek
      - ak11620427


  - name: updated
    type: datetime
    description: Time when the event was most recently updated. Times are reported in milliseconds since the epoch.

  - name: place
    type: string
    description: |
      Textual description of named geographic region near to the event. This may be a city name, or a Flinn-Engdahl Region name.
    examples:
      - "South of the Fiji Islands"
      - "23km WSW of Willow, Alaska"

  - name: type
